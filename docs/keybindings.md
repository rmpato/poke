You should not need this page. `ctrl+k` opens a command palette that searches
everything pogo can do and shows each command's key beside it, so the shortcut
is learned by using it. `?` opens the same list as a reference, generated from
the same registry — it cannot go stale.

## Everywhere

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `ctrl+k` | Command palette — search every action by name |
| `H` | Home — the shell above the list |
| `q`, `ctrl+c` | Quit |
| `esc` | Back — leave a screen, close an overlay, or clear the search |
| `?` | Help |
| `S` | Reveal masked secrets (toggle) |

## The list

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `k` / `↓` `j` | Move |
| `tab` | Move between the sidebar and the list |
| `\` | Show or hide the sidebar |
| `g` / `G` | Top / bottom |
| `ctrl+u` / `ctrl+d` | Half page up / down |
| `⏎` | Inspect |
| `/` | Search |
| `t` | Cycle grouping: by API → chronological → by host → by collection |
| `space` | Fold the group you are in; on a closed one, open it |
| `z` | Fold every group, or open every group |
| `A` | APIs and environments |
| `r` | Replay |
| `e` | Edit, then run |
| `y` | Copy menu |
| `s` | Star / unstar |
| `c` | File under a collection |
| `E` | Switch environment |
| `u` | Install an available update |
| `x` | Delete |
| `d` | Mark for comparison; press `d` on a second request to diff |

## The sidebar

On terminals at least 108 columns wide, a sidebar lists what is in your
history: filters (all, starred, failed), the APIs you have called with their
environments nested underneath, and your collections — each with a count. `tab`
focuses it, `⏎` applies the row as a search — and the search box then shows the
query it ran, which is how the filter syntax below gets learned without reading
this page.

Wider than 160 columns, a third pane previews the selected request.

## Search

Free text matches method, URL, status, note and error. Filters can be combined,
and repeating a filter ORs its values.

| Token | Matches |
|---|---|
| `users/42` | anything containing the text |
| `api:acme.com` | one API, however many hosts it has |
| `env:staging` | one environment, across every API |
| `method:POST` | one method |
| `status:404` | one status code |
| `status:4xx` | a status class |
| `host:api.example.com` | a host (substring) |
| `is:starred` | starred requests |
| `collection:auth` | filter by collection |
| `is:failed` | requests that failed or returned ≥ 400 |

Example: `method:POST status:5xx api:acme.com` — failing writes to one API,
in any of its environments.

Header *values* are deliberately not searched, so a search for `token` does not
match every authenticated request.

## Inspecting

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | Next / previous pane (also `l` / `h`) |
| `1` – `5` | Overview, Request, Response, Timing, Raw |
| `v` | Cycle the body view: tree → pretty → raw |
| `↑` `↓` | Move the JSON cursor in tree view, otherwise scroll |
| `space` | Fold or unfold the JSON node under the cursor |
| `g` / `G` | Top / bottom |

## Editing

`e` opens the request as fields: method, URL, query parameters, headers and
body.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` | Move between fields |
| `⏎` | Edit the focused field (or open the body) |
| `← →` | Change the method without typing |
| `ctrl+d` | Remove the focused header or query parameter |
| `ctrl+t` | Switch between fields and the raw curl command |
| `ctrl+e` | Hand the command to `$EDITOR` |
| `ctrl+r` (or `ctrl+⏎`) | Run it |
| `esc` | Cancel, or leave the field being edited |

Edits are applied to the **original command**, not used to regenerate one. A
request carrying `--cacert`, `--resolve`, `-k` or anything else pogo does not
model keeps every one of those options when you change a header. `ctrl+t` shows
the exact command your edits produce.

Running an edited command records a **new** entry pointing back at the one it
came from. The original is never modified.

Values are shown unmasked while editing — you cannot edit what you cannot see —
and the editor lists any `{{variables}}` the command references, marking the
ones the active environment cannot supply.

> `ctrl+⏎` only reaches an application in terminals that can distinguish it from
> `⏎`; `ctrl+r` works everywhere, which is why it is the documented binding.

## APIs and environments

`A` opens the workspace where pogo shows what it worked out about your hosts.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` | Move between APIs and their environments |
| `⏎` | Show that API's requests (or that one environment's) |
| `p` | Pin every host in the selected environment — stop guessing |
| `n` | Name the API |
| `x` | Hide or show the API |
| `esc` | Back to the list |

The same corrections are available from the command line as `pogo api pin`,
`pogo api move`, `pogo api name` and `pogo api hide`. See [APIs](apis.md).

## Home and settings

`H` leaves the list for the shell above it: Requests, APIs and environments,
Settings, the keyboard reference, and the walkthrough shown on a first run.

Settings holds the handful of decisions that are genuinely personal — theme,
what gets redacted, whether to check for releases — plus where every file lives.
Each change is written on the keypress that makes it; there is no save key,
because there is no unsaved state to get wrong.

## Copying

`y` opens the menu; press the letter, or move and press `⏎`.

| Key | Copies |
|---|---|
| `c` | The curl command |
| `C` | The curl command with secrets masked — safe to paste into an issue |
| `u` | The URL |
| `h` / `H` | Request / response headers |
| `b` / `r` | Request / response body |
| `j` | The whole entry as JSON |

Copying uses `pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, `xclip` or `xsel`, and falls back to an
OSC 52 escape so it also works over SSH and inside tmux.
